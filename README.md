# Carousel

This sample carousel project was generated with Angular2  - [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## General Description

1) No external plugin has been used to create the carusel
2) Since the component made is only one no seperate module has been created.
3) The carousel images and data has been populated from a static JSON file assuming it can be a dynamic Web API. Which will be easy to change without touching front-end code.
4) Responsive ui, Accessbility area tags are binded dynamically.
5) Have used bootstrap, font-awsome icons for header (can be replaced with custom icons realtime) and scss for styling purpose. Web Font has been applied on link (<a> tag) just for sample use.
